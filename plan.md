# Submission plan

## Objectives

The submission should answer the following questions:

1. What is FiLM?
2. How does FiLM relate to the current literature on neural network
   conditioning?
3. Why are feature-wise interactions important?
4. Do the observations made in the FiLM paper hold for other problem settings
   (e.g., image stylization)?
5. How can we leverage FiLM to interpret the computation carried out by the
   conditioned network?
6. Can we make a case for a soft program synthesis interpretation of FiLM?
7. Can we relate FiLM to our understanding of how the brain works?

## Milestones

The following steps need to be completed in order to achieve the objectives
outlined above:

1. Craft a write-up explaining FiLM:
   1. Write a textual and mathematical description.
   2. Produce animated diagrams of a network (fully-connected _and_
      convolutional) conditioned with FiLM.
2. Write a section on the connections between the current deep learning
   literature and FiLM:
   1. Build a literature survey on conditioning methods in deep learning, with a
      short description of the ideas and the connection to FiLM for each paper.
   2. Turn the literature survey into a fully-fledged article section.
3. ???
4. Repeat the analysis on FiLMed networks for other modalities:
   1. Artistic style transfer.
   2. Speech recognition.
   3. NLP.
5. ???
6. ???
7. ???
